Attribute Name,Sample Value,DataType,Description
Executive_cap,"['Trial', 'Non-Trial']",STRING,"There is a column called Executive Capability, which is used in exceptional cases for specific capabilities. For instance, in the capability column ""Source Lead Completeness,"" the Executive Capability column may contain values like ""Trial"" and ""Non-Trial"" specific to that capability."
Capability,"['ABM Recommendation Flow', 'Source Lead Completeness']",STRING,"Capability is also called as category. Category refers to the high-level groupings or classifications of essential processes and functionalities that are critical to the success of a particular operation or business function. Each category is further broken down into Category_Metrics_Product, channels, and Channel_Attribute. The structure of a category typically includes a category name, Category_Metrics_Product with targets, channels with targets, and Channel_Attribute with targets."
Metrics,"['Completeness', 'Accuracy', 'Timeliness']",STRING,"A metric is a quantifiable measure used to track and assess the status or performance of a specific business function There are three different types of metrics present, which are Completeness, Accuracy, and Timeliness. Completeness refers to the degree to which data is complete and contains all the required information. Accuracy refers to the degree to which data is correct and free from errors. Timeliness refers to the degree to which data is current and up to date. "
Category_Metrics_Product,['ABM Recommendations Covered By Sellers'],STRING,"Commonly referred to as ""Metrics"" or ""Metric,"" this column represents the category-level product metrics. In general usage, users often simplify the term to ""metric"" or ""metrics."" Within the hierarchy, it falls below the capability or category level. As the name suggests, this field is used to represent metrics associated with a specific category and product."
Channel,"['By Segment', 'By Priority List', 'By Source system']",STRING,"Represents the various pathways or segments through which data flows and is analysed such as By Segment, By Priority List, By Source system etc."
Channel_Attribute,"['Latam', 'ANZ', 'Germany']",STRING,"This is also known as Attribute. Represents the granular level of data within a Channel, providing detailed insights into specific aspects of the data flow. These are the individual data points or characteristics that make up the broader metrics and categories."
Owner,['Signal Flow Health & AI - Connor M'],STRING,"Owner refers to the person or team who is responsible for managing and overseeing a particular category or project. They are accountable for the success or failure of the category or project and are responsible for making decisions, setting goals, and ensuring that the team is working towards achieving those goals. In the provided context, different categories have different owners such as Adrian Andac for Signal Flow Support, Matthew Woodley for Marketo Programs Creation, and Eileen Suico for Lead Data Collection: Trial."
Overall,"[29387, 1754]",INTEGER,"Overall represents the total or cumulative count of leads, accounts, or data points across all levels within a selected category_metric_product, Channel, or Attribute. It offers a broad view of the entire data set and helps in understanding the overall performance of a particular category or metric. In simple terms, it gives an overview of the data without going into the details of specific filters or criteria."
Actual,"[29387, 1754]",INTEGER,"""Actual"" refers to the count of leads, accounts, or data points that meet specific filters, criteria, or requirements defined by the category_metric_product, Channel, or Attribute. It enables a detailed assessment of performance according to the established standards or expectations for each metric. In simpler terms, it shows how well a particular aspect of the business is performing based on specific criteria."
Target,[0.99],FLOAT,"The target represents the predefined benchmark or goal set for each Metric, Channel, and Attribute. It is the desired level of performance that the CS&M Data Team aims to achieve. The target is used as a reference point to measure the actual performance of the data against the established standards or expectations for each metric. By comparing the actual performance with the target, the CS&M Data Team can identify areas of improvement and take corrective actions to ensure that the data meets the desired level of quality and completeness."
Attainment,"[0.9612, 0.9394]",FLOAT,"Attainment represents the degree to which specific goals or targets have been met within the context of CS&M operations. This ratio is typically expressed as a percentage, indicating the extent to which the actual performance meets or exceeds the full scope of the data or objectives. In the provided context, attainment is used to measure the performance of various metrics, channels, and attributes against their predefined targets or benchmarks. The attainment level is categorized as green, orange, or red based on the percentage of target achieved. Green indicates that the target has been fully achieved, orange indicates that the target has been partially achieved, and red indicates that the target has not been achieved."
Delta,"[0.0288, 0.0506]",FLOAT,"Delta represents the difference between Target and Attainment. This column is necessary for the AT_Flag column, which categorizes results into red, yellow, and green categories. If Delta is less than 0, it indicates that Attainment is equal to or greater than Target. If Delta is less than or equal to 5, it means Attainment is less than Target by up to 5. If Delta is greater than 5, it signifies that Attainment is lower than Target by more than 5."
Previous_Attainment,"[0.9373, 0.9384]",FLOAT,"""Previous Attainment"" refers to the attainment figure from the previous month, while ""Attainment"" represents the number for the current month."
Hierarchy_Flag,"['Metric_Level', 'Channel_Level', 'Attribute_Level']",STRING,"The Hierarchy Flag indicates the hierarchy level of a row within the entire dataset. If the hierarchy is at the metric level, it means that the row represents information and figures specific to that category_metric_product level. The same applies to the attribute and channel levels."
AT_Flag,"['Red', 'Green', 'Yellow']",STRING,"This column represents the status of a metric using three values: Red, Green, and Yellow, determined by the Delta value. If the Delta is less than or equal to 5, the AT_Flag is marked as Yellow. If the Delta exceeds 5, it is marked as Red, and if the Delta is negative (less than 0), it is marked as Green. This flag provides a concise visual indicator of the metric's status based on its Delta value."
Month,"['October', 'November']",STRING,This column represents the month during which the data was extracted. It serves as a timestamp to identify the specific time period associated with the data.
MOM (Month-over-Month),"[0.0239, 0.0373]",FLOAT,This column represents the difference between the values in the Attainment column for the current month and the Previous_Attainment column for the previous month. It provides a measure of change or variance between the two consecutive months.
MOM_Flag,"['Red', 'Green', 'Yellow']",STRING,"This column represents the status of a metric using three values: Red, Green, and Yellow, determined by the MOM value. The flag is determined as follows: it is marked as Yellow if the MOM value equal to 0, Green if the MOM value is greater than 0(positive), and Red if the MOM value is less than 0 (negative). This provides a clear visual representation of the Month-over-Month status."
